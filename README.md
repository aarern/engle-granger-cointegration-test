# Engle-Granger Cointegration Test

## Description
This test for cointegration between asset pairs, which means a long term statistical correleation and equilibrium. If the prices of the assets diverge in the shortterm, that presents an opportunity to arbitrage by shorting the overpriced asset and buying the underpriced asset till the prices revert to the mean. This test pairs assets by the same industry and runs statistical tests based on three years of historical price data, then uploads the completed test to a designated desktop folder. Asset pairs that have an alpha less than 5% are statistically cointegrated and can be arbitraged if there is a short term mispricing.

## Getting Started
If you'd like to run this test, the cointegration python script can be run after installing the necessary pips. I hardcoded all of the NASDAQ tickers in there for simplicity. 

## Results
The results of this test are as of 05/23/2025. The file named "01-cointegration_results_2025-05-23" Contains 37 asset pairs.
